## City Road Segmentation Dataset: A Dataset for Deep Road segmentation

Welcome to the City Road Segmentation Dataset, an extensive collection of radar images from 8 different cities, meticulously prepared for road segmentation using deep learning techniques. With over 900 high-resolution RGB images, each sized at 256x256 pixels, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating road segmentation algorithms.

**Dataset Features:**

1. **Diverse City Coverage:** Our dataset encompasses radar images from eight distinct cities, providing a wide range of urban environments and road layouts. This diversity ensures that your road segmentation model can generalize well across various cityscapes.

2. **High-Quality Radar Images:** Each image in the dataset has been captured using advanced radar technology, resulting in crisp and clear visuals. The high resolution of 256x256 pixels allows for fine-grained details to be captured, aiding in accurate road segmentation.

3. **Road Masking:** To facilitate road segmentation tasks, our dataset includes meticulously labeled road masks for every image. These masks precisely identify the road regions, enabling efficient training and evaluation of segmentation models.

4. **RGB Image Format:** The radar images are provided in the popular RGB format, allowing researchers and practitioners to leverage color information for enhanced segmentation accuracy. The RGB representation provides valuable contextual cues for differentiating roads from surrounding areas.

5. **Ready for Deep Learning:** The dataset is organized and formatted to seamlessly integrate with deep learning frameworks. You can readily utilize this data to train and fine-tune various convolutional neural network architectures for road segmentation tasks.

**Potential Applications:**

1. **Urban Planning:** The availability of accurate road segmentations aids in urban planning initiatives, enabling urban designers to analyze and optimize transportation networks efficiently.

2. **Autonomous Vehicles:** This dataset can be leveraged to train road segmentation models for autonomous vehicles, improving their ability to navigate and understand road structures in diverse urban environments.

3. **Infrastructure Development:** Road segmentation plays a crucial role in infrastructure development projects, helping engineers and policymakers identify areas that require maintenance or expansion.
